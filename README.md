Tech interviews can be intimidating. They often have several phases, from the first technical phone screen, to a remote coding interview or assignment, to the final on-site interview and whiteboard challenge.

To be ready for this process, it’s not always enough to just have the raw tech skills. You also need to be able to perform under pressure, talk through your code to give the interviewer a window into your thoughts, and be clear and precise with your tech vocabulary and communication.

As with most things in life, the way to build up your confidence and experience is through practice. If we know what we’ll be facing in technical interviews and have done a ton of trial runs, we can breeze through the real thing

These interview questions are real; they are not pulled out of computer science textbooks.
